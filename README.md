## How to test

- A admin user has already been created. Go to http://localhost:8080/admin/ and enter user => admin and password => admin123@;
- Inside postman, perform a get to http://localhost:8080/employee/. A list of employees must be returned;
- Inside postman, perform a post to http://localhost:8080/employee/ with body (a new employee must be added):
```
{
   "name": "Renato Jos√© da Silva",
   "email": "renatojsilvas@gmail.com",
   "department": "Developer"
}
```

- Inside postman, perform a delete to http://localhost:8080/employee/4/. The employee that has id=4 must be deleted;

## How to clean
```
docker-compose down --v
```

## How does it works?

There is a nginx server that receives the requests. This server works as reverse proxy that forward the requests to gunicorn server. Besides, the nginx serves the static files. Gunicorn is a webserver that translates http into something python can understand. The request hits the django instance that communicates with a postgres database. The  django  instance returns a response to the gunicorn which returns the reponse to the nginx which returns the response to the user.  


## Issues
- There is no authentication/authorization;
- docker-compose up should be invoked once. If you need to perfom the command again, clean the database with docker-compose down --v. The docker-compose up create a new superuser with the same name created before. It is needed to fix it;
